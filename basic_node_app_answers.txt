> What is a Node module?

A: A set of functions that can be included in an application, similarly to JavaScript libraries.

> What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

A: `exports` is `module.export`'s little helper. `module.exports` is returned to the caller, not `exports`. `exports` only collects properties and attaches them to `module.exports`. 

> Why is using exports recommended?

A: if you define methods with module.exports and then reassign `module.exports` it will break the usage of any of the defined methods in applications, whereas if you define methods with `exports` and then reassign `exports`, the application won't break because `exports` is a reference to `module.exports` and cannot actually reassign `module.exports`.
